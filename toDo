siamese tracker - input video 

2nd - benchmarking concept : possible scenarios:occlusions, simple tracking, illimuniation, clutter, 
	precison, recall, etc.  
	reading in from default video file
	record output (text file and video file)
	useable dataset
	what exists, 

point cloud 6 DOF temporal tracker


3rd yolo	
	positiotnal info
	algorithm flowchart
	know where to make tweaks for positional info

siamese 1st
	get working with webcam

benchmark object detectors

focus is on human tracking (2d)
3d will be human and something else

BDAT - object detection

LSART - not feasible realtime (1 FPS) Titan X
CFCF - not feasible realtime (1.7 FPS) Tesla K40 (200x200 target object)

MCCT - to investigate - author claims 8 FPS (GTX1080) - implemented
GNET to investigate
