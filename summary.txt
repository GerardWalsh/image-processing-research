Tracking paradigm
	2D
	Generic object tracking is ideal for many use cases - State of the art approach for object tracking in a 2D space has no prior information of the object to be tracked
		This leads to low accuracy, robustness especially to scenarios of occlusion and multiple instances
		This is suboptimal - the human visual tracking system has knowleadge of the object to be tracked
			Human visual system has general understanding of how objects look in different poses/viewpoints etc
	As noted, this approach only utilizes 2D information, however in a 3 channel input format (Width - Height - Depth) 
		The human visual system relies on depth information (two sensors)
	2D object tracking has well defined metrics, challenges and benchmarks
		VOT - visual object tracking challenge
			Realtime and overall challenge
				Realtime - processes input faster than it receives input
				Overall - Only judged on metrics of precison, robustness, accuracy, area under curve, not processing time

		MOT - multiple object tracking challenge

	Implemented trackers
		CMTgpu
			scores high in occlusion according to VOT 2017 results, but not accurate
			Does well with redetection, poorly in clutter, vast viewpoint changes
			~80 FPS	
			Implemented in c++ (OpenCV) - webcam testing possible
		SiameseFC
			Winner of VOT realtime challenge 2017
			~40-60 FPS
			Scores amongst highest overall performers in VOT challenge, but runs at a magnitude of order faster
			Evaluated on challenging scenarios - sequence with humans and occlusion, does not perform well, loses human it was tracking
			Implemented in Tensorflow, webcam testing not possible - easy to test with predefined sequences
		RE3
			Very fast, lightweight tracker, 70-100FPS
			Investigated to be used amongst other navigation systems
			Does not perform well, latches onto objects, redetection is very poor/non-existent
			Implemented in Tensorflow - webcam testing possible
		MCCT (Gnet)
			Not fast, does well with occlusion, successfully tracked human in occlusion
			Implemented in matlab/mxnet
			GPU implementation did not function, GPU implementation should bring promising results - CPU not catered for dealing with ConvNets
			Webcam testing not possible - easy to test with predefined sequences
			Possibilty for further anaylsis

	Nonimplemented trackers
			Not implemented due to low FPS ( << 5 FPS) on high end hardware (Server GPU - NVIDIA TESLA)
			chosen for their high scoring attributes for illumination change, occlusion
			LSART 
				Robust and accurate, amongst highest
			CFCF 
				Robust and accurate too, amongst highest scoring
		
Object detection/Classification
	Similar problem case to generic object tracking
		Differs in that we have a defined set of classes and that we seek to:
			Given a single image, classify the object into a class (Classification)
			Given a single image, classify the object into a class and localize the image (Classification+Localization)
			Given a single image, localize and classify objects (Object detection)
			Given a single image, segment pixel belonging to seperate classes (Semantic segmentation)
			Given a video stream, classify and locate objects 
		In this task we train the detectors on a given set of training examples of the defined classes and perform the above mentioned tasks on
			Various datasets
				ImageNet 2010 - Popular challenge, no structure to images in dataset
				Microsoft COCO(Common objects in Context) 2015 - images are of objects in their natural context 

	Implemented object classifiers/detectors
		ImageNet challenge 
			Object detection from video
				Tested on scene with many cars, does not pick up the majorty of cars
				Uses ~2GB of memory on GTX1060 6GB
				~20-30 FPS

		COCO challenge
			YOLOV3
				tinynets weights utilized - full YOLOV3 uses more than 6GB of GPU memory
				YOLO performs as good as state of the art on mAP50 (overlap of .50 - Redmond argues higher overlap is indiscernbile to humans
				~40 FPS

	Nonimplemented object classifiers/detectors
		ImageNet
			Object detection
				No pretrained weights for top-performing submission (BDAT)
				Instructions for training weights
			Classification + localization
				No pretrained weights for top-performing submission (BDAT)
				Instructions for training weights
			Not feasible 
				Above methods are operating on single images 
				Not feasible (in a real-time situation) in terms of processing speed and does not utilize temporal information from video frames

	Trade-off between speed and accuracy (As most things are)
		Need to discern use case and determine what approach/algorithm is feasible
			What are we looking to achieve from algorithm
				Accurate bouding boxes or is 0.5 IOU acceptable
		Networks can be retrained to be more lightweight/accurate
			Network only has to discern between human and car door, etc. 


Problem at hand
	We have information regarding what object is to be tracked
		CAD model
	We have a defined set of classes to be tracked
		Not open ended set of objects
	We have an array of sensor data available - RGB, RGBD, Point Clouds from LIDAR
	High accuracy is req
