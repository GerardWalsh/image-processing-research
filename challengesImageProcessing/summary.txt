Tracking paradigm
	2D
	Generic object tracking is ideal - State of the art approach for object tracking in a 2D space has no prior information of the object to be tracked
		This leads to low accuracy, robustness especially to scenarios of occlusion and multiple instances
		This is suboptimal - the human visual tracking system has knowleadge of the object to be tracked
			Might not know exactly how the specific instance of object looks in various poses, viewpoints and levels of occlusion, we do have a general understanding of the object to be tracked and how it appears in different scenarios
	As noted, this approach only utilizes 2D information, however in a 3 channel format (Width - Height - Depth) 
		The human visual system relies on depth information (two sensors)
	2D object tracking has well defined metrics, challenges and benchmarks
		VOT - visual object tracking challenge
			Realtime and overall challenge
				Realtime - processes input faster than it receives input
				Overall - Only judged on metrics of precison, robustness, accuracy, area under curve

		MOT - multiple object tracking challenge

Object detection/Classification
	Similar problem case to generic object tracking
		Differs in that we have a defined set of classes and that we seek to:
			Given a single image, classify the object into a class (Classification)
			Given a single image, classify the object into a class and localize the image (Classification+Localization)
			Given a single image, localize and classify objects (Object detection)
			Given a single image, segment pixel belonging to seperate classes 
			Given a video stream, classify and locate objects 
		In this instance we train the detectors on a given set of training examples of the defined classes and perform the above mentioned tasks on
			Various datasets
				ImageNet 2010 - Popular challenge	
				Microsoft COCO(Common objects in Context) 2015 - images are of objects in their natural context 

Problem at hand
	We have information regarding what object is to be tracked
		CAD model
	We have a defined set of classes to be tracked
		Not open ended set of objects
	We have an array of sensor data available - RGB, RGBD, Point Clouds from LIDAR
