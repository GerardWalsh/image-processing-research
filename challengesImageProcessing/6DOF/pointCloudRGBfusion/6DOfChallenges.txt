Pascal 3D+ - Benchmark for 3D object detection in the wild
	Average Viewpoint Precision (AVP) - evalute object detection and pose estimation 
		detector output correct iff bounding box overlap is larger than 50% AND the viewpoint is correct (i.e., the two viewpoint labels are the same in discrete viewpoint space or the distance between the two viewpoints is smaller than some threshold in continuous viewpoint space). The recall is the same for AP and AVP.
