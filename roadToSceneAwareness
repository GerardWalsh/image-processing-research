Generic object trackers
	RGB - do not make use of depth information
	No prior knowleadge of object to be tracked
	Therefore lack robustness (dropping of object) and accuracy (overlap of bounding box)
	Highest performing trackers are not real-time, low frame rates ( < 10 FPS) on powerful hardware, not utilising hardware efficiently 
	Struggle with occlusion of similar/same objects (people crossing each other/walking in front of each other)

Can make use of more sensor data (RGBd)
	Will aid in occlusion scenarios - system will be aware of occlusion due to depth change of during occlusion (person walking infront of another - depth map changes, as well as 2D spatial information)

Can have idea of model desired to be tracked
	Object detector/classifier (trained for specific instance, set of useful classes (not toothbrushes)) can inform object tracker of what object needs to tracked, where the object is
	Tracking algorithm receives information from object detector/classifier/localisor regarding object and pulls CAD model from memory/file

Can achieve higher image processing speeds as does not need to be able to discriminate between toothbrush on a table and a gymnast performing cartwheels
